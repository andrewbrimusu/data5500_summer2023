This week begins the study of Artificial Intelligence.

You will be introduced to the high level concepts of intelligence, and also study AlphaGo.  This discussion of "what is intelligence", sets the stage for artificial intelligence and its capabilities.

This week you should each:

1. Review the quiz prior to watching AlphaGo (so you know what material/concepts to keep an eye out for)

2. Watch the AlphaGo Documentary.   This is free on youtube.

3. Take the quiz.  The essay questions on the quiz, are meant to be thought provoking - there is not necessarily a right answer.

 

Enjoy!
